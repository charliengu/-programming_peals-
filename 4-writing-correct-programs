initialize range to 0..n-1
loop
  {invariant: mustbe(range) }
  if range is empty, then
    break and report that t is not in the array
  else
    compute m, the middle of the range
    use m as a probe to shrink the range
      if t is found during the shrinking process,
      break and report its position
